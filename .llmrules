# LLM Rules

## Context-First Workflow

1. **Before editing any file**: Check if `/.context/{same-path}.md` exists
2. **If exists**: Read it first — understand scope before touching code
3. **If not exists**: File is simple/new, proceed directly
4. **After significant changes**: Update corresponding `.context/*.md`

## Code Style

- **No inline comments** unless logic is truly non-obvious
- **Self-documenting**: Clear naming over explanations
- **Minimalist**: Only what's needed, nothing extra
- **No over-engineering**: Solve the current problem, not hypothetical futures

## What NOT To Do

- Don't add comments explaining what code does (make code clear instead)
- Don't create abstractions for one-time operations
- Don't add features beyond what's requested
- Don't bloat context files — they're maps, not documentation

## Token Efficiency

- Read `.context/` summaries first, full source only when needed
- Context tells you *where* to look, not *everything*
- Keep responses focused and actionable

## Communication

- Be direct and concise
- Ask clarifying questions early, not mid-implementation
- When uncertain, investigate before assuming
